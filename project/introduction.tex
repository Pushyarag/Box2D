\section{RUBE GOLDBERG MACHINE}
\subsection{About Rube Goldberg machine}
\paragraph{}
This report is made to describe the concepts behind our CS251
project Box2d simulation.
 In this project we have created a simulation of a Rube Goldberg machine we designed, in C++ using the Box2D library.
 A Rube Goldberg machine is a contraption that performs a simple task in a complicated fashion.
 We have created a GUI interface for visualization of the simulation and a non-GUI version for analysis of code statistics. We profile the code using gprof, the inbuilt Linux profiling tool, in order to identify which part of the simulation is taking the maximum amount of time to execute. Using this information, we optimize the code. In this report we have given a gist of our design, its salient features and working. Also this report gives the observations on the profiling of the code and the possible optimizations that can be done.
 
 
 

\subsection{About our project}
\paragraph{}

Our main motive of doing this project is to get to know and work with a lot off new stuff like box2d, makefiles,etc and learn the application of all the things we learned in this course.

The project is about a bucket alarm which will pour water on a sleeping person.
Our main idea is to keep the clock going,and make arrangements such that the contraption starts and finally invert the bucket of water so that the water falls on the person so he wakes up.
